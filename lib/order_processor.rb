class OrderProcessor
  ##
  # Responsible for processing an order which means deduct the inventory of work and process the charge
  #
  # provides methods for `hold!` and `charge!`. Both of these try to first deduct the inventory and then try to process payment.
  # Caller should check `failed_inventory?` and `failed_payment?` errors to verify the success of hold/charge.
  # In case of `failed_payment?`, the actual payment error can be accessed via the `transaction` attribute of the processor.
  #
  # the caller needs to verify the results by checking `failed_inventory?` and `failed_payment?` methods.
